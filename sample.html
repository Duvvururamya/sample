<h1><font>USING FONT TAG WITH ATTRIBUTES</font></h1><hr><hr><hr>

Python iterable and Python iterator are different.The main difference between them is, iterable in Python cannot save the state of the iteration,
<p align="right">whereas in iterators the state of the current iteration gets saved.
Here, we are trying to get the next element from the iterator after the completion of the for-loop. 
Since the iterator is already exhausted,<br>it raises a StopIteration Exception. Whereas, using an iterable, 
we can iterate on multiple times using for loop or can get items using indexing.
Don't miss your chance to ride the wave of the data revolution! Every industry is scaling new heights by tapping into the power of data.</p><hr><hr>
